Here's a list of questions frequently posed by our users.

== I'm getting a NullPointerException in NamespaceManager.get()

CapeDwarf bundles the original appengine-api jar file in +%CAPEDWARF_HOME%/modules/com/google/appengine/main+.
 Legal restrictions don't allow us to bundle a pre-modified jar with CapeDwarf, which is what CapeDwarf needs in order to work correctly.
 If you are bundling the jar in your WAR (as is usually the case), CapeDwarf will automatically modify the jar in your WAR.
 However, if you are *not* including the jar in your WAR, CapeDwarf will automatically use the jar in the modules dir. In order for it
 to work properly, you must modify the JAR yourself, either by manually running +%CAPEDWARF_HOME%/bin/capedwarf-bytecode.sh+ or +capedwarf-bytecode.bat+;
 or by running CapeDwarf with +capedwarf.sh+ or +capedwarf.bat+.

If you do not include the appengine jar in your war and you also do not run +capedwarf-bytecode.sh+ and you start CapeDwarf with +standalone.sh+ instead of
+capedwarf.sh+, you will get errors similar to the following:

The key thing that signals that you are using the original +appengine-sdk.jar+ and not the modified version, is the presence of +SearchServiceImpl+ in the stack trace.
If the modified jar was being used, the search service implementation class would be +CapedwarfSearchService+. All other service implementations in CapeDwarf also begin
with +Capedwarf+ and do not end with +Impl+.




== I get a 404 Not Found when I try to access my servlets

Our handling of +static-files+ in +appengine-web.xml+ is not 100% correct. If your +appengine-web.xml+ includes all paths as
static files, none of your servlets will be available. To work around this, remove the following line from +appengine-web.xml+:

[source,xml]
----
<static-files>
    <include path="**" />
</static-files>
