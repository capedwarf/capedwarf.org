This is a short guide on how to install CapeDwarf and run your existing App Engine application on it. For more in-depth
documentation on configuring and using CapeDwarf, refer to the link:/documentation/user-guide/[User Guide].


== Step 1: Download and unzip CapeDwarf

To download CapeDwarf, go to link:/downloads[Downloads]. Currently, you may choose to download _CapeDwarf on JBossAS7 (CapeDwarf version 1.x)_
or on the newer _WildFly Application Server (CapeDwarf version 2.x)_. Unzip the downloaded zip file to a location of your
choosing (in order to avoid bugs itâ€™s always good practice to install into a directory path that does not include spaces or
special characters).

Let's refer to the folder you unziped CapeDwarf into as +%CAPEDWARF_HOME%+.


== Step 2: Run your existing app on CapeDwarf

Assuming you already have an existing GAE application, you probably have the whole application in a directory somewhere on your
hard drive. The easiest way of deploying the app is by running +%CAPEDWARF_HOME%/bin/capedwarf.sh <location of app>+.

Let's say your application is located at +/home/me/my_gae_app/war/+ and you've installed CapeDwarf into +/home/me/capedwarf/+,
you run the app on CapeDwarf with the following command:

----
/home/me/capedwarf/bin/capedwarf.sh /home/me/my_gae_app/war
----

CapeDwarf should start up and print a bunch of lines to the console. The last line should look something like this:

----
14:46:19,930 INFO  [org.jboss.as] (Controller Boot Thread) JBAS015874: JBoss Capedwarf 2.0.0.CR5 (WildFly 8.2.0.Final) started in 2875ms - Started 228 of 429 services (249 services are lazy, passive or on-demand)
----


== Step 3: Navigate to the app in your browser

Your app is now deployed and should be available at http://localhost:8080. The admin console is available at
http://localhost:8080/_ah/admin - same as on Google App Engine.

Certain GAE service APIs, like the Mail Service API, XMPP Service API, need to be manually configured in order to function properly
on CapeDwarf. Please refer to the link:/documentation/user-guide/[User Guide] for more information.
