It's been a while since our last release. But that doesn't mean we haven't been busy.
With Google App Engine's ManagedVMs getting more and more traction, we figured out we needed to support that too.
And voila, a new https://github.com/capedwarf/capedwarf-managed[CapeDwarf Managed] project was created.

But in order to not duplicate the code between Managed and Blue, some refactoring was required, hence the delay.
And along the way - while implementing Managed - we saw we were also missing a few things in Blue as well: warmup request and GAE-like HTTP session handling.

To cut the long story short, here is the latest Blue download:

And the release notes:

More about Managed in the future blog post -- asap!

Feedback welcome as always!
