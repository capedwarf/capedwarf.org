As you can see from the JIRA release notes, it’s been super busy 2 months.

Another new sub-project: CapeDwarf Shared.

- https://github.com/capedwarf/capedwarf-shared

It’s where we keep the shared code between our GAE API implementation (Blue) and JBossAS integration.

There has been a lot of detail polishing on Blobstore, Logging and TaskQueue.
And we also added BlackList / WhiteList support, getting even closer to GAE behavior this way.

Also big thanks to https://github.com/bartv[Bart] and http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/showMember.do?memberID=u0059687[Wouter] for the patches and feedback.

And yes, we finally simplified how you start the whole thing - thanks https://github.com/matejonnet[Lazo]. 

- ./capedwarf.sh or capedwarf.bat (in JBOSS\_HOME/bin/) will do

As always, feedback welcome!
