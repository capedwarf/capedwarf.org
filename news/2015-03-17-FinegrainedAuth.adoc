There was a small bug on how we handled security constraints -- it should re-direct you to login page in case of non-authorized access.
This is now fixed. While we also added fine-grained configuration of authorization mechanism, and moved default to GAE/CapeDwarf mechanism.

I've also created new Docker image, with this release, under "alesj/capedwarf".
