As the title - taken from a cheesy romantic movie :-) - says, we now finally have proper mail API support on CapeDwarf.

We also moved our http://www.capedwarf.org[capedwarf.org] site to Awestruct and Asciidoctor, plus adding a bunch of content to it -- faq, docs, blogs, …

CapeDwarf now uses WildFly 8.0.0.Final underneath, which fixed some of the deployment’ concurrency handling issues.
