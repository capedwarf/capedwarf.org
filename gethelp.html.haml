          %h2 CapeDwarf Mailing List
          %p
            This is a mailing list geared towards developing CapeDwarf itself.  It often contains deep, technical discussions on how WildFly works internally, how new features could be implemented, and is definitely not the place for end user questions such as how to configure, use or even troubleshoot WildFly.  Please use the User Forums for such questions.
          %p
            If, however, you are helping contribute to CapeDwarf, we welcome your thoughts, ideas and overall participation on the developers' mailing list.
